        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Explore Lalakhal</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Lalakhal is a wide channel in the Sharee River near the Tamabil road. The river is not very deep but one 
            of the major sources of sand in Sylhet. The main attraction of the river is the variety of colours of the water, which varies from 
            green to turquoise to clear at different points. The water of the river has a turquoise hue due to the limestone deposits in the river.
            Excessive mineral and sand harvesting in the recent years has put the river at a risk of degradation.</p>
             <div class="bg-secondary text-white p-6 border border-4 border-black rounded-3">
                <h2><u>𝓐𝓫𝓸𝓾𝓽 𝓛𝓪𝓵𝓪𝓴𝓱𝓪𝓵</u></h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Lalakhal, one of the most popular tourist destinations, is situated in Jaintapur Upazila, next to 
                    the Tamabil road, 35 kilometres from Sylhet. The tranquillity of nature can be experienced while exploring Lalakhal's unique 
                    scenery while participating in various recreational activities. <br><br>

                    The origin of the name 'Lalakhal' is a mysterious one. In Bengali, 'Lalak' means red or redness, while 'Khal' means a canal or 
                    river. The name Lalakhal comes from the scarlet hue that the river Shari's water takes on in the winter. <br><br>
                    
                    During winter, water from the hills carries red silt and other sediments downstream, eventually settling on the riverbank. As 
                    a result, the water in Lalakhal takes on a reddish tint resembling the colour 'Lal' (red), which is how the place got its 
                    name. <br><br>
                    
                    When you arrive at Lalakhal, make sure to watch for the beautiful red river that gives the location its name. This river adds 
                    to the already stunning scenery, making Lalakhal an enchanting place to visit. The area's mixture of limestone and sediments 
                    creates the perfect environment for the water to display its mesmerising scarlet hue.</p>
                <h2>How to go there?</h2>
