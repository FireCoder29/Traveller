        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Explore Ratargul</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Ratargul is a place of Syhlet,Bangladesh. The famous spot of Ratargul is Ratargul Swamp Forest. 
            Bangladesh, with its vibrant landscapes and lush greenery, especially during the rainy season, beckons nature enthusiasts 
            to explore its natural wonders. One of the crown jewels among these is Ratargul Swamp Forest.</p>
             <div class="bg-secondary text-white p-6 border border-4 border-black rounded-3">
                <h2><u>𝓐𝓫𝓸𝓾𝓽 𝓡𝓪𝓽𝓪𝓻𝓰𝓾𝓵</u></h2>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Ratargul is the only 'freshwater swamp forest' in our country. The distance from Sylhet to this 
                    country's only recognized swamp forest is about 20 kilometers. The location of this water forest is Khadimnagar union of Sadar 
                    Upazila of Sylhet district and Fatehpur union of bordering Upazila Gowainghat.

                    The Goain River, which flows down from Meghalaya in the north, has a huge haor in the south. In the middle of the 'Jalaban' 
                    Ratargul. According to Wikipedia, there are only 22 freshwater wetlands in the world. There are two Indian subcontinents, one 
                    in Sri Lanka and the other in our Ratargul.
                    
                    Amazon is the only one that can be compared with this beautiful forest. Although known as the Rain Forest, the Amazon is the 
                    largest freshwater swamp forest in the world. This freshwater forest is our Ratargul just like the Amazon swamp.
                    
                    In the local language of Sylhet, murta or patigacha is known as 'Ratagacha'. The name of this forest is Ratargul after the 
                    name of that idol or Ratagachera. Like the Amazon, most of the vegetation stays underwater for four to seven months a year. 
                    The waters of Meghalaya in India flow into the Goain River, and a narrow tributary of the Chengi Canal floods the entire 
                    Ratargul wetland. There is almost always water in the forest during the monsoon season (May-September). In winter, of course, 
                    it happens, and like ten forests, it is a dry land with fallen leaves. And the small canals become footpaths. And then the 
                    aquatic fauna is sheltered in the big lakes dug by the forest department. 
                    
                    The state of this water is very strange in the rainy season. Up to the waist of a tree is submerged in water. Those that are a 
                    little smaller, they are half submerged in water again. Fishermen are getting fishing nets somewhere. The whole forest seems 
                    to be dark because of the dense vegetation. Occasionally the tree stalks will block the path. They have to be removed by hand. 
                    However, in the rainy season, you have to be very careful in this forest. Because Ratargul is the arena of snakes. In the 
                    rainy season, snakes take their place on the trees. <br><br>
                    
                    According to the forest department, the area of this forest is 3325.61 acres. Of these, 504 acres of forest was declared a 
                    wildlife sanctuary in 1983. There are about 25 species of water tolerant plants in this huge forest. Although it is a natural 
                    forest, the forest department has planted various species of water tolerant trees including cane, kadam, hijal and murta. In 
                    the Ratargul forest, there are many venomous species of snakes, including non-venomous guisap, jaladhora and gokhra. When 
                    water enters the forest in the rainy season, these snakes fall on the trees. <br><br>
                    
                    Many species of wild animals including fish tigers, squirrels, monkeys, otters, wild cats, beji and foxes roam in the forest. 
                    Tengra, khalisha, ritha, pabda, maya, ayr, kalbaus, rui and many more species of fish are found in this forest. Birds include 
                    white buck, kani buck, mashranga, tia, bulbuli, pankauri, dhupi, pigeon, kite and falcon. In winter, all the vultures come 
                    from time to time. And after crossing a long path, various species of birds including sand ducks come to the base. In the dry 
                    season, if you go inside with a dinghy, flocks of birds will fly away and make their way to you. This scene is really rare! <br><br>
                    
                    There are more trees here. Hijle has hundreds of fruits. Bots will also catch the eye from time to time. And south of the 
                    forest is the predominance of murta (patti) trees. The forest department has commercially installed sculptures in a large part 
                    of Ratargul. The idol is cooled. There are more idols on the opposite side of the river. Besides, there are two big haors 
                    named Shimul Beel Haor and Neva Beel Haor.</p>
