        <h2>About Traveller</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the 
            Old French word travail, which means 'work'.[2] According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word travel 
            was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment, labor, 
            strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil).

            In English, people still occasionally use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book The Best 
            Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the 
            tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale).[citation needed] This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel 
            in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier, depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, 
            the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult 
            depending on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock cart.[3]
        
            Reasons for traveling include recreation,[4] holidays, rejuvenation,[5] tourism[4] or vacationing,[4] research travel,[4] the gathering
             of information, visiting people, volunteer travel for charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages[4] and 
             mission trips, business travel,[4] trade,[4] commuting, obtaining health care,[4] waging or fleeing war, for the enjoyment of 
             traveling, or other reasons. Travelers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or vehicles, such as public 
             transport, automobiles, trains, ferries, boats, cruise ships and airplanes. <img src="images/Image20241218203801.png" width="30%" style="float: right;">

            Motives for travel include:
            
            Pleasure
            Relaxation
            Discovery and exploration
            Adventure
            Intercultural communications
            Taking personal time for building interpersonal relationships.
            Avoiding stress
            Forming memories
        
            Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities 
            such as Pompeii and Baiae.[8] While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, 
            cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.[9] 
            Humankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World from Spain in 1492, an expedition 
            which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century when aircraft allows travel from Spain to the United 
            States overnight.

            Travel in the Middle Ages offered hardships and challenges, though it was important to the economy and to society. The wholesale 
            sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea-voyagers, end-user retailing often demanded the 
            services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, gyrovagues (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought 
            theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels toured, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and 
            in sundry other wars.[8] Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally 
            and internationally.[10]
            
            In the late 16th century, it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper-class men to travel to significant 
            European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the Grand Tour, and included cities such as 
            London, Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome. However, the French Revolution brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.[8]
            
            Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th 
            century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel 
            was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalized on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains 
            and hotels were booked together.[11] Airships and airplanes took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th 
            century, notably after the Second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.[8] Air travel has become so 
            ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, Alexis Alford, visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.[12]</p><br><hr>
